          The Yagi–Uda antenna typically consists of a number of parallel thin
          rod elements, each approximately a half wave in length. Often they are
          supported on a perpendicular crossbar or "boom" along their centers.
          Usually there is a single
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driven_element" class="link"
            >driven</a
          >
          element in the center (usually but not always consisting of two rods
          each connected to one side of the transmission line), and a variable
          number of
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_element" class="link"
            >parasitic elements</a
          >, reflectors on one side and optionally one or more directors on the
          other side. The parasitic elements are not electrically connected to
          the transmission line, and serve as
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_radiator" class="link"
            >passive radiators</a
          >, reradiating the radio waves to modify the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_pattern" class="link"
            >radiation pattern</a
          >. Typical spacings between elements vary from about 1⁄10 to 1⁄4 of a
          wavelength, depending on the specific design. The directors are
          slightly shorter than the driven element, while the reflector(s) are
          slightly longer. The radiation pattern is unidirectional, with the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_lobe" class="link"
            >main lobe</a
          >
          along the axis perpendicular to the elements in the plane of the
          elements, off the end with the directors.
          <br />
          <br />
          Conveniently, the dipole parasitic elements have a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(physics)" class="link"
            >node</a
          >
          (point of zero
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_frequency" class="link"
            >RF voltage</a
          >) at their centre, so they can be attached to a conductive metal
          support at that point without need of insulation, without disturbing
          their electrical operation. They are usually bolted or welded to the
          antenna's central support boom. The most common form of the driven
          element is one fed at its centre so its two halves must be insulated
          where the boom supports them.
          <br />
          <br />
          The gain increases with the number of parasitic elements used. Only
          one reflector is normally used since the improvement of gain with
          additional reflectors is small, but more reflectors may be employed
          for other reasons such as wider bandwidth. Yagis have been built with
          up to 30–40 directors.
          <br />
          <br />
          The bandwidth of an antenna is, by one definition, the width of the
          band of frequencies having a gain within 3 dB (one-half the power) of
          its maximum gain. The Yagi–Uda array in its basic form has very narrow
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(signal_processing)"
            class="link"
            >bandwidth</a
          >, 2–3 percent of the centre frequency. There is a tradeoff between
          gain and bandwidth, with the bandwidth narrowing as more elements are
          used. For applications that require wider bandwidths, such as
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_television"
            class="link"
            >terrestrial television</a
          >, Yagi–Uda antennas commonly feature trigonal reflectors, and larger
          diameter conductors, in order to cover the relevant portions of the
          VHF and UHF bands. Wider bandwidth can also be achieved by the use of
          "traps", as described below.
          <br />
          <br />
          Yagi–Uda antennas used for
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio" class="link"
            >amateur radio</a
          >
          are sometimes designed to operate on multiple bands. These elaborate
          designs create electrical breaks along each element (both sides) at
          which point a parallel
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC_circuit" class="link">LC</a>
          (inductor and capacitor) circuit is inserted. This so-called trap has
          the effect of truncating the element at the higher frequency band,
          making it approximately a half wavelength in length. At the lower
          frequency, the entire element (including the remaining inductance due
          to the trap) is close to half-wave resonance, implementing a different
          Yagi–Uda antenna. Using a second set of traps, a "triband" antenna can
          be resonant at three different bands. Given the associated costs of
          erecting an antenna and rotator system above a tower, the combination
          of antennas for three amateur bands in one unit is a very practical
          solution. The use of traps is not without disadvantages, however, as
          they reduce the bandwidth of the antenna on the individual bands and
          reduce the antenna's electrical efficiency and subject the antenna to
          additional mechanical considerations (wind loading, water and insect
          ingress).
