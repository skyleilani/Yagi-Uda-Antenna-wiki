          While the above qualitative explanation is useful for understanding
          how parasitic elements can enhance the driven elements' radiation in
          one direction at the expense of the other, the assumption of an
          additional 90 degrees (leading or lagging) phase shift of the
          reemitted wave is not valid. Typically, the phase shift in the passive
          element is much smaller. Moreover, to increase the effect of the
          passive radiators, they should be placed close to the driven element,
          so that they can collect and reemit a significant part of the primary
          radiation.

          <br />
          <br />

          A more realistic model of a Yagi–Uda array using just a driven element
          and a director is illustrated in the accompanying diagram. The wave
          generated by the driven element (green) propagates in both the forward
          and reverse directions (as well as other directions, not shown). The
          director receives that wave slightly delayed in time (amounting to a
          phase delay of about 45° which will be important for the reverse
          direction calculations later). Due to the director's shorter length,
          the current generated in the director is advanced in phase (by about
          20°) with respect to the incident field and emits an electromagnetic
          field, which lags (under far-field conditions) this current by 90°.
          The net effect is a wave emitted by the director (blue) which is about
          70° (20° - 90°) retarded with respect to that from the driven element
          (green), in this particular design. These waves combine to produce the
          net forward wave (bottom, right) with an amplitude somewhat larger
          than the individual waves.
          <br />
          <br />
          In the reverse direction, on the other hand, the additional delay of
          the wave from the director (blue) due to the spacing between the two
          elements (about 45° of phase delay traversed twice) causes it to be
          about 160° (70° + 2 × 45°) out of phase with the wave from the driven
          element (green). The net effect of these two waves, when added
          (bottom, left), is partial cancellation. The combination of the
          director's position and shorter length has thus obtained a
          unidirectional rather than the bidirectional response of the driven
          (half-wave dipole) element alone.
          <br />
          <br />

          When a passive radiator is placed close (less than a quarter
          wavelength distance) to the driven dipole, it interacts with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_and_far_field" 
          class="link">near
          field</a>, in which the phase-to-distance relation is not governed by
          propagation delay, as would be the case in the far field. Thus, the
          amplitude and phase relation between the driven and the passive
          element cannot be understood with a model of successive collection and
          reemission of a wave that has become completely disconnected from the
          primary radiating element. Instead, the two antenna elements form a
          coupled system, in which, for example, the self-impedance <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_resistance" class="link">(or
          radiation resistance)</a> of the driven element is strongly influenced by
          the passive element. A full analysis of such a system requires
          computing the mutual impedances between the dipole elements[12] which
          implicitly takes into account the propagation delay due to the finite
          spacing between elements and near-field coupling effects. We model
          element number j as having a feedpoint at the centre with a voltage Vj
          and a current Ij flowing into it. Just considering two such elements
          we can write the voltage at each feedpoint in terms of the currents
          using the mutual impedances

              How the antenna works. The radio waves from each element are
              emitted with a phase delay, so that the individual waves emitted
              in the forward direction <i>(up)</i> are in phase, while the waves
              in the reverse direction are out of phase. Therefore, the forward
              waves add together,

              Illustration of forward gain of a two element Yagi–Uda array using
              only a driven element (left) and a director (right). The wave
              (green) from the driven element excites a current in the passive
              director which reradiates a wave (blue) having a particular phase
              shift (see explanation in text, note that the dimensions are not
              to scale with the numbers in the text). The addition of these
              waves (bottom) is increased in the forward direction, but leads to
              partial cancellation in the reverse direction.
