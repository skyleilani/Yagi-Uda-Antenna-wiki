            There are no simple formulas for designing Yagi–Uda antennas due to the complex relationships between physical parameters such as
            <br/> <br/>
            <ul>
            <li>element length and spacing</li>
            <li>element diameter</li>
            <li>performance characteristics: gain and input impedance</li>
            </ul>
            However using the above kinds of iterative analysis, one can calculate 
            the performance of a given a set of parameters and adjust them to optimize 
            the gain (perhaps subject to some constraints). Since with an n element Yagi–Uda 
            antenna, there are 2n − 1 parameters to adjust (the element lengths and relative 
            spacings), this iterative analysis method is not straightforward. The mutual 
            impedances plotted above only apply to λ/2 length elements, so these might need
             to be recomputed to get good accuracy.
            <br/><br/>
            The current distribution along a real antenna element is only approximately given by 
            the usual assumption of a classical standing wave, requiring a solution of
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hallen%27s_integral_equation&action=edit&redlink=1" class="link">Hallen's integral equation</a> 
             taking into account the other conductors. Such a complete exact analysis, considering all 
             of the interactions mentioned, is rather overwhelming, and approximations are inevitable on
             the path to finding a usable antenna. Consequently, these antennas are often empirical designs
             using an element of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_and_error" class="link">trial and error</a>, often starting with an existing design modified according 
             to one's hunch. The result might be checked by direct measurement or by computer simulation.
            <br/><br/>
            
            A well-known reference employed in the latter approach is a report published by 
            the United States National Bureau of Standards (NBS) (now the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology" class="link">National Institute of 
            Standards and Technology (NIST))</a> that provides six basic designs derived from measurements
             conducted at 400 MHz and procedures for adapting these designs to other frequencies.
              These designs, and those derived from them, are sometimes referred to as "NBS yagis."
            <br/><br/>
            
            By adjusting the distance between the adjacent directors it is possible to reduce the back lobe 
            of the radiation pattern.

                Two Yagi–Uda antennas on a single mast. The top one includes a corner reflector and three stacked 
                Yagis fed in phase in order to increase gain in the horizontal direction (by cancelling power 
                radiated toward the ground or sky). The lower antenna is oriented for vertical polarization,
                 with a much lower resonant frequency.
